<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a student artist studying art and design at<br>
  the University of Illinois at Chicago, class of 2021.<br>
  A lot of my work started when I learned photography<br>
  and from there I started to branch out into other forms<br>
  of art, as well as design. </p>

<h1>Work</h1>

<h2>Header Project</h2>
  <img src=Images/finldig.png>
<p> This is the original picture I edited for a digital header.<br>
  The header is inspired by my love for spooky things and the<br>
  colors that exist in my closet and hair color. </p>

<h2>Text Editing Project</h2>
  <img src=Images/textedt.png>
<p> This is a screenshot of the text I edited for my digital header.<br>
    The project was challenging as I tried to manipulate the font to<br>
    match the complexity of the curves and sharpness of my header image.<br>
    I decided that a serif font would be the best choice as I can round<br>
    the serifs at the ends of the font to be round and sharp, as<br>
    well as stretching the lettering to match the line work within<br>
    the image. </p>

<h2>Roommates: A Twine Game</h2>

<p> Roommates is a twine game I created. In this game, you are an<br>
    entity and you have to find something to do. In the images I have<br>
    screenshots of the actual game. Originally the game was supposed<br>
    to be a horror game, but my love for comedy and irony led me to<br>
    take the game on a different route. The first two images are of<br>
    the outline of the game and the stylesheet I used to edit the<br>
    text and background of each scene. The last two images are parts<br>
    of the game when you pick your choices.
